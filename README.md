# CSS-Style-site
100daysofcode-day52_53

As part of my 100 days of coding challenge, I spent this week learning HTML and CSS basics this week.

The end of the day project was to use HTML and CSS to build a personal portfolio site. I used HTML and CSS to create a very basic site that shows my basic understanding of HTML and CSS.


What is HTML?
According to Google, "Hypertext Markup Language, a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages."
HTML is used to create almost all websites.

To use HTML, you need to learn about HTML attributes and Elements. There are hundreds of HTML elements. HTML elements can be divided into two groups block and inline.

  What are Block Elements?
    - A block-level element always starts on a new line.
    - A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
    - A block-level element has a top and a bottom margin, whereas an inline part does not.
	  - Common Block Elements
      ○ Paragraphs (<P>)
      ○ Headers (<h1> - <h6>)
      ○ Division (<div>)
      ○ Lists and list items (<ol>, <ul>, and <li>)
      ○ Forms (<forms>)
 
  What are Inline Elements?
	- An inline element does not start on a new line.
	- An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
	- Note: An inline element cannot contain a block-level element!
	- Common inline Elements:
    - <a>
    - <span>
    - <i>
    - <img>
 
 
What is CSS?
According to Google, "Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML."

Anatomy of CSS
  Selector: Who do you want to change? Ex. HR, H1, H#, etc.
  Property: What do you want to change? Ex. Border, height, width, etc.
  Value: How do you want to change it? Ex. Color, size, position, etc.
